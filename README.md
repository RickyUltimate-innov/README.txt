<u>### Hey, I'm Ricky Ultimate!</u>

I'm a front-end developer with UI/UX design skills (front-end designer), Robotics and Software engineering skills.

I've been living on the base of Robotics and web development and creating user friendly designs. I have learnt a lot and had the chance to submerge myself in different projects and works, alongside other people, trying to make life advanced through robotics design & code. I'm always trying to learn something new.

  I love to code with TypeScript and sometimes CoffeeScript
